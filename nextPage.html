            <p>The hobby that I put the most into is collecting and playing Magic: the Gathering. 
                I play Izzet mostly and will dip into black but rarely play green or white. 
                My favorite format is commander. I would like to play Canadian Higlander but no one really plays that here.
                Most of this is probably just confusing for people who don't understand Magic.</p>

            <p>I enjoy reading a lot. I mostly read fantasy series and books. 
                My favortite series currently is Brandon Sanderson's Stromlight Archive. 
                In addition to those books being my favorite series, Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author.
                I prefer my books to have large worlds with lots of lore and detail, characters come second for me.</p>
