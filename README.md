# ISQA3900Activity2

This is a simple web application that I designed to show my experience level with HTML and CSS.
It is split into two HTML files, one CSS file, and three JPGs.

This web application is hosted by GitHub pages at this location: https://leeyoder.github.io/ISQA3900Activity2/.
You can navagate through the application via the links in the top right corner.
