            <p>I am a computer science senior at the University of Nebraska Omaha. My major is computer science and I have a minor in math. 
                I am familiar with Java, C++, Perl, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. I have taken classes on database management and data mining. 
                I enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming. </p>

            <p>Most of my web design experience comes from Advanced Java and the random HTML assignments in other classes. 
                I am fairly confident in my ability in my HTML and CSS. CSS is the one that I am least experienced (meaning I am self taught). </p>
